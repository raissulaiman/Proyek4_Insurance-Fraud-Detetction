# Proyek4_Insurance-Fraud-Detetction

Now, I will present my project Insurance Fraud Detection. This project explained about detecting fraud in Insurance, whether are the customer is fraud reported or not.

In this project, I will use machine learning classification with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and SVM, all the methods from the library scikit-learn, then determine which method will have the highest accuracy.
