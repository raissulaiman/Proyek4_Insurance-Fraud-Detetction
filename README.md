# Proyek4_Insurance-Fraud-Detetction

Now, I will present my project Insurance Fraud Detection. This project explained about detecting fraud in Insurance, whether are the customer is fraud reported or not.

In this project, I will use machine learning classification with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and SVM, all the methods from the library scikit-learn, then determine which method will have the highest accuracy.

The goal is to find the best method from classification machine learning to detect insurance fraud, we can see there are underfitting or overfitting in those data if we process the data with the methods and we can see with the score of each method.
