# Proyek4_Insurance-Fraud-Detetction

Now, I will present my project Insurance Fraud Detection. This project explained about detecting fraud in Insurance, whether are the customer is fraud reported or not.

In this project, I will use machine learning classification with [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning), [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm), and [SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine), all the methods from the library scikit-learn, then determine which method will have the highest accuracy.

This project is divided into 3 section:
1. Upload the dataset and read the dataset
2. Display information about the dataset using describe function
3. Checking correlation between features and predict with the models
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- SVC
4. Conclusion, with look at the confusion matrix and accuracy/score each method

The goal is to find the best method from classification machine learning to detect insurance fraud, also we can see there are underfitting or overfitting in those data if we process the data with the methods then look at the score of each method.
